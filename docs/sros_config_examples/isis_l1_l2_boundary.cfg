# Nokia SR-OS ISIS L1/L2 Boundary Configuration
# Demonstrates L1/L2 boundary behavior (critical for NRS-2)
# Equivalent to demo_isis_l1_l2_boundary.sh in this lab

# L1 Router (Area 49.0001)
configure router isis
    system-id 0000.0000.0001
    area-id 49.0001
    interface "to-l1l2-router"
        interface-type point-to-point
        level-capability level-1
    exit
exit

# L1/L2 Router (Area 49.0001, connects to L2)
configure router isis
    system-id 0000.0000.0002
    area-id 49.0001
    interface "to-l1-router"
        interface-type point-to-point

# L2 Router (Area 49.0002, different area)
configure router isis
    system-id 0000.0000.0003
    area-id 49.0002

# Verification commands:
# show router isis adjacency
#   - Shows L1 and L2 adjacencies separately
# show router isis adjacency detail
#   - Shows area-id and level for each adjacency
# show router isis database level 1
#   - Shows L1 LSP database
# show router isis database level 2
#   - Shows L2 LSP database
# show router route-table protocol isis
#   - Shows routes learned via L1 and L2

# Key NRS-2 concepts demonstrated:
# - L1 adjacencies form only within same area-id
# - L2 adjacencies form across area boundaries
# - L1/L2 routers form both L1 and L2 adjacencies
# - Route leaking: L2 routes advertised to L1 via L1/L2 router
# - SPF calculation: Separate SPF for L1 and L2
